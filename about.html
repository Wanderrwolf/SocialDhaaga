  <h2>Weaving Brands into Culture</h2>
  <p>
    Social Dhaaga was built on a simple belief:  
    brands don’t grow by shouting louder, they grow by becoming part of culture.

  <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    India isn’t one market. It’s a collection of languages, communities, emotions, and
    identities. Culture is what connects them. We help brands move from generic communication
    to culturally rooted presence that earns trust, relevance, and long-term loyalty.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Culture Before Campaigns</h3>
      <p>
        We start with people, communities, and conversations, not just media plans and formats.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Creators as Cultural Partners</h3>
      <p>
        We work with creators as storytellers and community leaders, not just distribution channels.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Community-Led Growth</h3>
      <p>
        We build ecosystems, not one-off collaborations, helping brands and creators grow together.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Long-Term Relevance</h3>
      <p>
        Our focus is not virality, but influence that compounds over time.
