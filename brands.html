  <h2>Visibility Is Easy. Influence Is Earned.</h2>

  <p class="section-intro">
    Campaigns create visibility. Culture creates influence.  
    Most brands invest heavily in the former and underestimate the latter.
    In a market like Gujarat, where language, identity, and community drive decisions,
    influence is built by becoming part of everyday culture, not just media plans.
